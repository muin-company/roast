# Style Guide

## The "No AI Vibes" Rule

This tool is built with AI, but it shouldn't **feel** like AI slop. Here's what that means:

### ❌ Avoid

- **Corporate cheerleading**: "Great job! 🎉" "You're doing amazing!"
- **Generic platitudes**: "Consider following best practices"
- **Emoji overload**: Every sentence doesn't need 5 emojis
- **Fake enthusiasm**: "I'm so excited to help you with..."
- **Robotic language**: "As an AI language model..."
- **Hedge words**: "Perhaps maybe you might consider possibly..."

### ✅ Do

- **Be direct**: Say what's wrong, why it matters, how to fix it
- **Be specific**: Quote actual code, reference line numbers
- **Be funny naturally**: Like a human developer would
- **Be useful**: Every roast should have actionable feedback
- **Be respectful**: Roast the code, not the person

## Tone Examples

**Bad (AI vibes):**
> "Great effort! 🌟 However, I noticed that perhaps you might want to consider using async/await instead of callbacks. It would be more modern! Keep up the good work! 💪"

**Good (human dev):**
> "🔥 Callback hell called, it wants its code back. Switch to async/await unless you enjoy debugging spaghetti."

**Bad (too mean):**
> "🔥 Did you write this with your eyes closed? This is the worst code I've ever seen."

**Good (roast with love):**
> "🔥 This function has more side effects than a pharmaceutical commercial. Let's make it pure."

## Output Structure

1. **Hook** - Start with the most interesting/funny issue
2. **Issues** - 2-4 specific problems with solutions
3. **Compliment** - End with something genuinely good or a useful tip

## Emoji Usage

Use emojis as **markers**, not decoration:
- 🔥 = Issue/roast
- 💡 = Suggestion
- ✨ = Compliment
- 🚨 = Serious bug

Don't: "This is so cool! 😎🚀✨💯🔥"

## Length

- **Roast mode**: 200-400 words
- **Serious mode**: 250-400 words
- Too short = not useful
- Too long = nobody reads it

## Shareability

Every roast should be:
- **Screenshot-friendly** - Fits in one image
- **Self-contained** - Makes sense without context
- **Quotable** - Has at least one memorable line

Remember: We're building a tool developers **want** to use, not one that feels like homework.
